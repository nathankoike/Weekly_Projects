# Weekly Projects

### Intro

Hi! My name is Nate, and I've decided to set a challenge for myself:
I want to program one thing every week.

### Goals

I'd like this idea of having weekly projects to be fun. I don't like having
to force myself to do things, and I would rather enjoy making things than feel
pressure from deadlines.

I'd like this to become a habit. I'll be in a different country next semester
and won't be able to study CS, so I'd like to be able to continue to hone my
skills, even if I do so without a classroom environment.

### Rules and Exceptions

I am allowed to work with other people.

I am allowed to use any language

I am not limited in the form of the project. It could be a website one week and
a terminal program the next.

Larger projects might take more than a week to finish. In that case, I will not
have a finished project, but I will likely still have a few commits. I may also
choose to skip a week to be with family or to settle into wherever it is that
I'll be living next semester.
